# iotdb-native
IoTDB Native is a specialized database management system for time series data generated by a network of IoT devices with low computational power. It targets a workload that has high-frequency data write, large-volume data storage, and complex analytical queries. IoTDB supports queries that are common in monitoring and collecting metrics in IoT devices, namely filtering by predicates, query by time range, group aggregation, and data sample. Data in IoTDB is stored in TsFile, a file format designed for accessing, compressing, and storing time series data. Its storage is organized in LSM based structure catering to write throughput.
